## **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Introduction**

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>System Architecture**

![image info](./_notes/1_sc1.png)

a mono repository with several microservices, using a common library

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Project Dependencies**

**<span style='color: #ffc5a6'>Link:** <https://pnpm.io/>

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Github Repository**

**<span style='color: #ffc5a6'>Link:** <https://github.com/mguay22/sleepr>

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Project Setup**

`nest new 1_sleepr-setup`, choose `pnpm` as package manager

`cd` into the project

`pnpm run start`

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Generate a common library**

`nest generate library common`, a `tsconfig.lib.json` is created and extends the root `tsconfig.json`.

root nestjs `tsconfig.json` is going to be shared amongst this common module library and all of the different applications and we can see the paths here that our application can use to access our common library

`nest.cli` has a `projects` section with the common library specified

the common library has a `common.service.ts`, as well as an `index.ts` exporting these, so that external applications can import them and use them.

## **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Common Library**

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Database & Config Module**

`cd sleepr`

`pnpm i @nestjs/mongoose mongoose`

`pnpm i @nestjs/config`

`nest generate module database -p common`

`nest generate module config -p common`

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> libs/common/config/config.module.ts**

`import { ConfigModule as NestConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';`

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:** the reason why we're abstracting our own config module and wrapping it around the nest one is because if we were to change the underlying configuration module, in this case the nest one, we only need to do it in one place

`NestConfigModule.forRoot()`,  we are telling the nest config module to load in any environment variables that we have in memory, and also to read in any dot env files we have in our directory, which will be super important later on when we use the config service to read in these environment variables.

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> tsconfig.json**

```json
"@app/common/*": [
    "libs/common/src/*"
  ]
```

we will always use our `@app/common` defined above so that we would have to change the path of that location in a single place only

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>joi**

`pnpm i joi` for data validation

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:** for below error, `import * as Joi from 'joi';`

![image info](./_notes/2_sc1.png)

if we remove our connection uri, we get the following error, as expected:

![image info](./_notes/2_sc2.png)

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Reservation CRUD**

creating our first microservice: *reservations*, `nest g app reservations` which will create a new `apps` directory

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> nest-cli.json** above command will add automatically a `1_sleepr` project reference that be removed in this file, and we also delete the folder created under `sleepr/apps/1_sleepr-setup`

![image info](./_notes/2_sc3.png)

for our mono-repo,  we also define our default project for `nest run` and `nest build` commands:

```json
"root": "apps/reservations"
"sourceRoot": "apps/reservations/src",
```

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:** when we start our nest application now defaulting to *reservations*: `pnpm start:dev`, our mongoose module is not initialized anymore, as when we created our monorepo via `nest g app reservations` deleted the `sleepr/src/app.module.ts` which was initializing this module:  that file

![image info](./_notes/2_sc4.png)

and we add it back to our **<span style='color: #aacb73'> reservations.module.ts**, which will initialize the moongose module when we start our app.

![image info](./_notes/2_sc5.png)

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>adding default CRUD**

in order to add some default CRUD functionality to our reservations service, we can also use the *nest cli*: `nest g resource reservations`, choosing the default *REST API* transport layer. This will create boiler plate code for our CRUD operations, `sleepr/apps/reservations/src/reservations/reservations.controller.ts`

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Validation & Logging**

`pnpm i class-validator class-transformer`

`pnpm i nestjs-pino pino-http`

`pnpm i pino-pretty`

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:** we're exposing the implementation for our logger in our individual microservice *reservations*. So if we have to reuse this, we would have duplicated code. I want to go ahead in our common library and create a new logger module that we can import into our individual microservices

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> reservation.module.ts**

```typescript
Module({
  imports: [
    DatabaseModule,
    DatabaseModule.forFeature([
      { name: ReservationDocument.name, schema: ReservationSchema },
    ]),
    LoggerModule.forRoot({
      pinoHttp: {
        transport: {
          target: 'pino-pretty',
          options: { colorize: true, singleLine: true },
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
})
```

`nest g module`, choose *common*

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> /reservations/src/main.ts**

`app.useGlobalPipes(new ValidationPipe({ whitelist: true, transform: true }));`: `whitelist` will be exclude extra properties not specified in the `dto`

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Dockerize**

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:**  when we have to run multiple applications at once, I want to take advantage of Docker compose to be able to run multiple images at once.

**<span style='color: #ffc5a6'>Docker Install:** <https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/>

**<span style='color: #f3b4ff'> Copilot** In VS Code, the "integrated terminal" is not tied to a specific terminal emulator like GNOME Terminal, but rather to the shell (e.g., bash, zsh) you configure. Installing `gnome-terminal` does not make GNOME Terminal available as an integrated terminal in VS Code. GNOME Terminal is a separate graphical terminal emulator.

*Summary*: You do not get GNOME Terminal inside VS Code. You get your chosen shell (zsh, bash, etc.) in VS Codeâ€™s built-in terminal panel. GNOME Terminal is only available as a standalone app outside of VS Code.

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Upgrade Docker Desktop**

<https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/ubuntu/#upgrade-docker-desktop>

When a new version for Docker Desktop is released, the Docker UI shows a notification. You need to download the new package each time you want to upgrade Docker Desktop and run: `sudo apt-get install ./docker-desktop-amd64.deb`

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>DockerFile**

`RUN npm install -g pnpm` will not install the *devDependencies* and make the production image much lighter

`COPY --from=development /usr/src/app/dist ./dist`: in this first stage of our docker file, when we run `npm build`, it's going to build our app to the `dist` directory, using the development dependencies. And then we want to take that app and put it into our production stage which doesn't have the development dependencies and plop it in the `dist` folder.

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:** `CMD ["node", "dist/apps/reservations/main"]`, this is the same folder structure as if we had run locally `pnpm run build`, the app would be built into a `dist` folder locally.

`docker build ../../ -f Dockerfile -t sleepr_reservations`

when we try to run our app, we get the below error, and to specify environment variables, we need to use **docker compose**.

![image info](./_notes/2_sc6.png)

```dockerfile
target: development
```

if we look at the Docker file, remember we have two different stages. We have the development stage and the production stage. I want to run the image from the development stage here so that we have all of the development dependencies we need when we are actually developing the app.

from *sleepr*, `docker-compose up` which will build and create our container and attach to the running container here. we can test a hot reload by adding any *console.log* to `/apps/reservations/src/main.ts`

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>dockerignore**

To make sure we ignore our disk directory so we're not copying over any pre-built *dist* folder, same for *node_modules*

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>mongo**

currently our dockerized app connects to Mongo Atlas, but instead if we want to create a new Docker image that runs Mongo and then we can connect our running app to that mongo image. We need to go to our *docker-compose* file and add a new service

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> docker-compose.yaml**

```dockerfile
mongo:
  image: mongo:latest
  ports:
    - '27017:27017'
```

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> .env**

Instead of pointing to our atlas host, what we need to do is actually change the host name here out for the name of the service, *mongo*, And so with networking in Docker, these containers can talk to each other by the name of the service, with the port 27017

`MONGODB_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/sleepr`

our nest application starts up and now talks to a mongo image with our dockerized application.

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>restarting docker-compose**

`docker-compose down && docker-compose up`

**<span style='color: #ffcd58'>IMPORTANT:** each time we will shutdown and restart our app, our mongo database will be recreated.

## **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Authentication**

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Users**

`nest g app auth`

`nest g module users`

`nest g controller users`

`nest g service users`

`pnpm start:dev auth`

### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Local Strategy**

`pnpm i brcypt @types/bcrypt`

**<span style='color: #8accb3'> Note:** Why are we getting access to a user document in our `auth.controller`?

The reason for that is because in our **<span style='color: #aacb73'> local-strategy.ts**,
in this validate call when we verify the user `verifyUser`, we returned the user. So whatever gets returned from this local strategy in the validate method here gets automatically added to the request object, as the user property.

**<span style='color: #aacb73'> TabButton.jsx**
`@Res({ passthrough: true }) res: any`: the reason we're going to do this is we're going to actually set the JWT as a cookie on the response object instead of passing as plain text, because I think HTTP cookies are much more secure.

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>bcryptjs**

`pnpm i bcryptjs`

We install an alternative to *bcrypt*, *bcryptjs* as well as make sure we actually have Express installed. we're going to use *bcryptjs* to avoid an issue with mounting our volumes in Docker and *express* to make sure we get the response types we need

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>connecting to Docker Mongo service**

**<span style='color: #ffcd58'>IMPORTANT:**

`docker exec -it sleepr_mongo_1 mongosh` to find the name of the container name: `docker ps`

switch to your correct app: `show dbs`, and then `use sleepr`

`show collections`, `db.userdocuments.find().pretty()`

#### **<span style='color: #6e7a73'>Cookie in our response**
